        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Abraham! I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a focus on Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. My interests lie in creating predictive models for various applications, particularly in finance and quantum computing.</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy teaching and have taught cybersecurity to over 60 students in an NSA-funded camp. I'm also passionate about solving optimization problems like Maxcut using algorithms.</p>

            <h3>Stock Market Prediction</h3>
            <p>Developed LSTM and Time Series Transformer (TST) models to predict stock prices, achieving a 5% increase over the S&P 500 during forward testing. Data was gathered using Yahoo Finance, and indicators were added to enhance model performance.</p>
