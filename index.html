        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Abraham! I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a focus on Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. My interests lie in creating predictive models for various applications, particularly in finance and quantum computing.</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy working on side projects and playing volleyball.</p>
